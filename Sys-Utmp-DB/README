comparison/testing of various utmp file processing perl mods

(Sys-Utmp-1.7 vs User-Utmp-1.8)

Sys-Utmp-1.7 : build on ob
User-Utmp-1.8 : has package for el, fails ob build

after dealing with 'sys utm', and seeing user-utmp fail -
thinking it best to just postprocess 'last' output.. 

so, previous efforts in 'utmpraw' dir
and current ones in 'lastparse' dir

misc todo:

  - review wtmp rotation on deployed hosts

    el5 logrotate.conf keeps 1x copy if log > 1m ..
    so *mostly* have records..

    todo:

      - fix rotation appropriately (stop rotation for now?)
      - make comprehensive 'fetcher' logic to get all available wtmps

        ... is sudo comprehensive.. is a script - should bmakeify..

  - create wtmp login db gizmomabob

Solaris Hosts
-------------
  - determine method to deal with unusual hosts e.g. solaris9
    solaris needs utmpx, which is not covered in current Sys::Utmp..
    is covered on User::Utmp, but this doesn't build on ob..

    so, 1) fix ob & port perl stuffs or 2) add utmpx to Sys::Utmp

    for now, ignoring, since solaris is all merenyi machines,
    which in turn are actually 'stat', and so shouldn't be in 
    global ece statistics...
