Dev Notes
=========

Developed on OpenBSD and RHEL7.

comparison/testing of various utmp file processing perl mods
------------------------------------------------------------

(Sys-Utmp-1.7 vs User-Utmp-1.8)

Sys-Utmp-1.7 : builds on ob
User-Utmp-1.8 : has package for el, fails ob build

Todo
----

  - review wtmp rotation on deployed hosts

    RHEL logrotate.conf keeps some copies, so *mostly* have records..

  - make comprehensive 'fetcher' logic to get all available wtmps

Later
=====

  - other platforms - e.g. Solaris:
    solaris needs utmpx, which is not covered in current Sys::Utmp..
    is covered on User::Utmp, but again, this doesn't build on ob..

    so, 1) fix ob & port perl stuffs or 2) add utmpx to Sys::Utmp

    for now, ignoring.
